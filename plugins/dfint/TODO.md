# Current issues

- [x] assertion error on quit
- [ ] artifacts on "half lines", probably due to resizing textures function
- [ ] new world creation missing reset cache event
- [ ] copy original string to temp value and then resize it - not the best solution (perf)
- [ ] handling "both half lines" not implemented
- [ ] string truncate

# Possible improvement

- [x] abstract ttf manager, make a module (draft concept)
- [ ] add dynamic texture loading to Texture module
- [ ] make an interface for the plugin
- [ ] hot reload for font and csv
