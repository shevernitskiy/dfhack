# Current issues

- [x] assertion error on quit
- [ ] artifacts on "half lines", probably due to resizing textures function
- [x] new world creation missing reset cache event
- [x] copy original string to temp value and then resize it - not the best solution (perf)
- [ ] handling "both half lines" not implemented
- [ ] string truncate

# Possible improvement

- [ ] abstract ttf manager, make a module
- [ ] add dynamic texture loading to Texture module
- [ ] make an interface for the plugin
- [ ] hot reload for font and csv
